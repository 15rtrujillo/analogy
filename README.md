This is a text comparison tool that I use to check assignment submissions in my classes. It works by finding the longest common subsequence between two assignments and reporting the ones that are too similar so I can manually review them.

This works best on plain text files (like code file submissions) but I've also added support for Word documents by utilizing a handy function I found online. Maybe one day I'll add support for PDFs, too, but I usually don't get a lot of those as submissions.

If you're curious about the name, "analogy" was one of the first things that popped up when I searched "something that compares things" and I liked it. It kind of feels like a codename or something.
